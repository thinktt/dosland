 The Emularity: An Example Computer Loader
 For use with The Emularity, downloadable at http://www.emularity.com/

 SIMPLE STEPS for trying an emulated computer ("Doom (shareware
 edition)" for the PC).

 * Check out this repository in your browser-accessible directory;
   this file as well as es6-promise.js, browserfs.min.js and loader.js
   are required. The logo and images directories are optional, but the
   splash screen looks quite a lot better when they're available.

 * Download the two files that comprise the compiled DosBox emulator:
   https://archive.org/download/emularity_engine_v1/dosbox-sync.js.gz,
   and https://archive.org/download/emularity_engine_v1/dosbox-sync.mem.gz.

 * Download a copy of Doom from https://archive.org/download/DoomsharewareEpisode/DoomV1.9sw1995idSoftwareInc.action.zip

 * Visit your example_dosbox.html file with a modern
   Javascript-capable browser.
